      <b>Hetionet</b> is an integrative
      <a href="/about/#what-is-a-hetnet">network</a>
      of biomedical knowledge assembled from
      <a href="/about/#whats-in-hetionet">29 different databases</a> of genes,
      compounds, diseases, and more. The network combines over 50 years of
      biomedical information into a single resource, consisting of

      Hetionet enables scientists and biologists to formulate novel hypotheses,
      predictions, and other valuable insights by connecting an existing body of
      biomedical data across multiple levels and types in a convenient,
      accessible, holistic way.
