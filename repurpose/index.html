      "Project Rephetio" was an study to predict new uses for existing drugs.
      Predictions are based on predicting treatment edges in
      <a href="http://localhost:4000/about/#what-is-hetionet">Hetionet v1.0</a>.
      Our approach learns network patterns of drug efficacy, translating the
      paths between a compound and disease into a predicted probability of
      treatment.
