      This project was a study to make predictions about disease-gene
      associations. Our approach learns what types of paths in a heterogeneous
      network occur more frequently between genes and diseases that have been
      associated by GWAS. Using <a href="/hnep">hetnet edge prediction</a> we
      predict the probability that each gene associates with each disease.
