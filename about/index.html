    <h3>What is a "hetnet"?</h3>
    A network (also known as a
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_(discrete_mathematics)"
      >"graph"</a
    >) is a way of representing a group of things (called <i>"nodes"</i>) and
    the relationships between them (called <i>"edges"</i>). Typical networks
    don't have multiple types of nodes or edges. However, types are crucial for
    representing rich biomedical knowledge, such that a gene is distinct from a
    disease, and a disease from a drug, etcetera.
    <br />
    <br />
    A <i>"hetnet"</i> (short for <b>het</b>erogeneous information
    <b>net</b>work) is a network where each node and edge has a type. (The term
    <i>"hetnet"</i> was selected amongst several possible alternatives in this
    <a href="https://doi.org/10.15363/thinklab.d104">2015 discussion</a>.)

    <h3>What is Hetionet?</h3>
    Hetionet is a hetnet of biomedical knowledge. It encodes relationships
    uncovered by millions of studies over the last half century. Hetionet is
    constructed from existing publicly available databases. It's open source.

  <div class="section">
    <h3>Why was Hetionet made?</h3>
    Hetionet v1.0 was created as part of Project Rephetio, which predicted new
    uses for existing drugs. By predicting missing network edges, Rephetio
    leveraged the power of the hetnet to turn biomedical knowledge into insights
    of drug efficacy. While resources were selected to be relevant for drug
    repurposing, Hetionet is now useful in a broader sense.<br />
    <br />
    Prior to their integration, these databases had to be analyzed separately.
    But now, Hetionet has performed the painstaking unification process, such
    that all the information is in one place in one common format. accessible,
    integrative

    <h3>What's in Hetionet?</h3>
    Hetionet combines information from 29 public databases into 11 types of
    nodes and 24 types of edges. Together, this forms a hetnet with XX nodes and
    XX edges. The schema below is the metagraph of Hetionet, showing the types
    that comprise the network.

    >
    <br />
    <br />
    For example, the metagraph shows the 11 node types in Hetionet. Notice that
    multiple types of edges can connect the same two nodes. For example, a
    compound can have a relationship to a gene by binding its protein and/or by
    upregulating it. Since the biological effect of binding versus upregulation
    are very different, it's important that the network captures this
    distinction.<br />
    <br />

    Hetionet was created openly, with public discussion and feedback throughout
    the process. First for each metanode, a standardized vocabulary was selected
    to define the nodes (e.g. Entrez Gene for genes or Disease Ontology for
    diseases). These vocabularies provide a common backbone of nodes to overlay
    edges onto, while preventing redundant concepts from forming separate nodes.
    Next, edges were extracted from omics-scale resources, converting
    identifiers to the appropriate node vocabularies. Edges were consolidated
    such that one relationship is encoded into a single edge, even when many
    studies or resources may have reported it. The sources of edges range from
    text-mining (e.g. Disease-presents-Symptom edges based on PubMed term
    cooccurrence) to high-throughput screens (e.g. Compound-upregulates-Gene
    edges based on millions of LINCS L1000 experiments). For more info

    When referring to the type of something in the network, we preprend "meta":
    i.e. metagraph, metanode, metaedge, metapath.

    <h3>Acknowledgements</h3>
    From 2011-2016, Development of Hetionet v1.0 was lead by Daniel Himmelstein
    and Sergio Baranzini at the University of California, San Francisco as part
    of Project Rephetio. Project Rephetio thanks its team of online contributors
    (https://git.dhimmel.com/rephetio-manuscript/#realtime-open-science-thinklab)
    who provided feedback throughout the course of the project. Daniel
    Himmelstein continues to develop applications of Hetionet and algorithms for
    hetnets as a postdoctoral fellow in the Greene Lab at University of
    Pennsylvania. <br />
    <br />

    Daniel Himmelstein's PhD work in the Baranzini lab was supported by the
    National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship under Grant No.
    1144247. Sergio Baranzini work was in part supported by the National
    Institutes of Health (R01 NS088155). Development of hetnet software,
    applications, and algorithms in the Greene Lab has been supported through a
    research collaboration with Pfizer Worldwide Research and Development and by
    the GBMF (Grant No). See the acknowledgement sections of related
    publications for grants supporting other collaborators and any additional
