    <h3>What is a "hetnet"?</h3>
    A
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_(discrete_mathematics)"
      >network</a
    >
    is a way of representing a group of things &ndash; called
    <i>nodes</i> &ndash; and the relationships between them &ndash; called
    <i>edges</i>. Typically, a network has only one type of node and one type of
    edge. But for a network of biomedical information, it is useful to be able
    to distinguish between different types of entities and relationships &ndash;
    e.g. a gene and a disease, an upregulation and a binding, etc.
    <br />
    <br />
    A <i>hetnet</i> (short for <b>het</b>erogeneous information <b>net</b>work)
    is a network where each node and edge has a type. (The term hetnet was
    selected amongst several possible alternatives in
    <a href="https://doi.org/10.15363/thinklab.d104">this 2015 discussion</a>.)

    <h3>What is Hetionet?</h3>
    Hetionet is a hetnet of biomedical knowledge. It encodes relationships
    uncovered by millions of studies conducted over the last half-century. The
    network is constructed from a collection of existing publicly available
    databases, and is itself
    <a href="https://github.com/hetio/hetionet#license"
      >open-source and free to use</a
    >.

    <h3>Why was Hetionet made?</h3>
    Hetionet was originally created as part of
    <a href="../rephetio">Project Rephetio</a>, a study that utilized the
    benefits of hetnets to predict new uses for existing drugs. Although the
    original resources for the network were selected for drug repurposing,
    Hetionet is now useful in a much broader sense, and
    <a href="../studies">has been used for a wide variety of purposes</a>.
    <br />
    <br />
    Hetionet was also made to alleviate some of the inaccuracies and
    inconveniences of using other integrative networks, or trying to use
    multiple, separate databases in the same analysis. It unifies data from
    several different, disparate sources into a single, comprehensive,
    accessible, common-format network. More about what makes the design of
    Hetionet special is described below.

    <h3>What's in Hetionet?</h3>
    Hetionet combines information from
    <a href="https://git.dhimmel.com/rephetio-manuscript/#tbl:resources"
      >29 public databases</a
    >. The network contains 47,031 nodes of
    <a href="https://git.dhimmel.com/rephetio-manuscript/#tbl:metanodes"
      >11 types</a
    >
    and 2,250,197 edges of
    <a href="https://git.dhimmel.com/rephetio-manuscript/#tbl:metaedges"
      >24 types</a
    >.<br />
    <br />
    The "metagraph" diagram below shows the connectivity between different types
    of nodes and edges in the network.
    <br />

    />
    <br />
    <i
      ><b>Note</b>: The prefix "meta" is used to refer to the type of the
      node/edge, as opposed to the node/edge itself (a specific gene, disease,
      etc.).</i
    ><br />
    <br />
    Notice that multiple types of edges can connect the same two nodes. For
    example, a compound can have a relationship to a gene by binding its protein
    and/or by upregulating it. Since the biological effects of binding and
    upregulating are very different, it is important for the network to capture
    this distinction.<br />

    <br />
    Hetionet was created openly, with public discussion and feedback throughout
    the process. First for each metanode, a standardized vocabulary was selected
    to define the nodes (e.g. Entrez Gene for genes or Disease Ontology for
    diseases). These vocabularies provide a common backbone of nodes to overlay
    edges onto, while preventing redundant concepts from forming separate nodes.
    Next, edges were extracted from omics-scale resources, converting
    identifiers to the appropriate node vocabularies. Edges were consolidated
    such that one relationship is encoded into a single edge, even when many
    studies or resources may have reported it. The sources of edges range from
    text-mining (e.g. Disease-presents-Symptom edges based on PubMed term
    cooccurrence) to high-throughput screens (e.g. Compound-upregulates-Gene
    edges based on millions of LINCS L1000 experiments). For more info
