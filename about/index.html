    <h3>What is a "hetnet"?</h3>
    <p>
      A <i>network</i> (also known as a
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_(discrete_mathematics)"
        >graph</a
      >) is a conceptual representation of a group of things &mdash; called
      <i>nodes</i> &mdash; and the relationships between them &mdash; called
      <i>edges</i>. Typically, a network has only one type of node and one type
      of edge. But in many cases, it is necessary to be able to distinguish
      between different types of entities and relationships.
    </p>
    <p>
      A <i>hetnet</i> (<a href="https://doi.org/10.15363/thinklab.d104"
        >short for</a
      >
      <b>het</b>erogeneous information <b>net</b>work) is a network where nodes
      and edges can be multiple types. This additional dimension allows a hetnet
      to accurately describe more complex data. Hetnets are particularly useful
      in biomedicine, where it is important to capture the conceptual
      distinctions between various components and mechanisms, such as genes and
      diseases, or upregulation and binding.
    </p>
    <p>
      The prefix <i>meta</i> is used on this site to refer to the type of the
      node/edge (e.g. compound), as opposed to the specific node/edge itself
      (e.g. acetaminophen).

    <h3>What is Hetionet?</h3>
    <p>
      Hetionet is a hetnet of biomedical knowledge. It encodes relationships
      uncovered by millions of studies conducted over the last half-century into
      a single resource. The network is constructed from a collection of
      publicly available databases, and is itself
      <a href="https://github.com/hetio/hetionet#license"
        >open-source and free to use</a
      >, barring any upstream restrictions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hetionet enables scientists and biologists to formulate novel hypotheses,
      predictions, and other valuable insights by connecting an existing body of
      biomedical data across multiple levels and types in a convenient,
      accessible, holistic way.

  <div class="section">
    <h3>Why was Hetionet made?</h3>
    <p>
      Hetionet was originally created as part of
      <a href="/rephetio">Project Rephetio</a>, a study that utilized the
      benefits of hetnets to predict new uses for existing drugs. Although the
      original resources for the network were selected for drug repurposing,
      Hetionet is now useful in a much broader sense, and
      <a href="/studies">has been used for a variety of purposes</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hetionet was also made to alleviate some of the inaccuracies and
      inconveniences of using other integrative networks, or trying to use
      multiple, separate databases in the same analysis. It unifies data from
      several different, disparate sources into a single, comprehensive,
      accessible, common-format network.

      The <i>metagraph</i> diagram below illustrates the connectivity between
      different types of nodes and edges in the network.
    </p>

        <img src="metagraph.png" width="400px" />
      </a>
    </figure>
    <p>
      Notice that multiple types of edges can connect the same two nodes. For
      example, a compound can have a relationship to a gene by binding its
      protein and/or by upregulating it. Since the biological effects of these
      two mechanisms are very different, they are given separate representations
      in the network.

    <h3>How was Hetionet made?</h3>
    <p>
      Hetionet was created openly, with a process of continuous
      <a href="https://think-lab.github.io/p/rephetio/discussion/"
        >public discussion and feedback</a
      >. In general, great care was taken to "clean" and "de-duplicate" the
      network such that it would be as easy and effective to use as possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      A standardized vocabulary was selected to define each metanode (e.g.
      Entrez Gene for genes or Disease Ontology for diseases). These
      vocabularies provide a robust, common backbone to overlay nodes and edges
      onto without repeating equivalent concepts.
    </p>
    <p>
      Edges were extracted from
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omics">omics-scale</a> resources
      (ranging from
      <a href="https://doi.org/10.15363/thinklab.d67">text-mining</a> to
      <a
        href="https://git.dhimmel.com/rephetio-manuscript/#transcriptional-signatures-of-perturbation-from-lincs-l1000"
        >high-throughput screens</a
      >) and their identifiers were converted to the appropriate node
      vocabularies. Edges were consolidated such that one relationship is
      encoded into a single edge, even when multiple studies or resources have
      reported it.
